# SEAproject_assesment
This is the Snap Engineering Academy Project Assessment! 
Here, both HTML and CSS will be used to create a fictional website for a small business in LA. 
Having some experience with web dev, I implemented: 
- an about the business section
- images describing the items
- a CSS file for styling
- a nav menu + multiple pages

Note: the webpage is unoffical and all credit is given to the owners!
